# Ensemble Bioinformatic Toolkit 
This is a collection of scripts for use with multiconformer or ensemble-based structural models. This contains scripts related to Seo et al 2025. 

NOTE: DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO THESE SCRIPTS IS STILL IN PROGRESS.

The directory is partitioned into three portions:
1) Individual Metrics: These are scripts applied to get information from PDBs, such as hydrogen bonds, SASA, close residues, etc.
2) Multiconformer Tools: These are scripts to identify patterns across PDBs.
