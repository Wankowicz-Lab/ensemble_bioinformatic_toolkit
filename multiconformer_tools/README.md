This folder contains scripts that can be used on multiconformer models. These models encode conformational heterogeneity using altlocs. If the PDB or mmCIF have multiple models, please use the ensemble scripts.


## Hydrogen Bond Analysis

This will take in a PDB and provide a CSV of all hydrogen bonds weighted by the relative occupancies of the two alternative conformers.
